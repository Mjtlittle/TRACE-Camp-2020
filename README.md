    - Reference: [Purrweb UI on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/11580352-Travel-App-Design-Concept)
    - I made the site just like the preview image, even though the rounded page is probably intended to be scaled to the size of the browser window. I did this because of the ability to directly compare to the reference aswell as for aesthetic reasons.
