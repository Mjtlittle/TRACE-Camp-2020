# TRACE-Camp-2020
A repository of all projects made for Clemson TRACE Camp 2020

## Projects
1. Group Introduction Project (with [Shawn Picardy](https://shawnpicardy.com/)): [Live Link](http://team4-liveshare.surge.sh/)
    - Went over html basics and looked into css style attributes
2. Dribble Recreation: [Live Link](https://jlittle-project-2.surge.sh/)
    - Reference: [Purrweb UI on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/11580352-Travel-App-Design-Concept)
    - I made the site just like the preview image, even though the rounded page is probably intended to be scaled to the size of the browser window. I did this because of the ability to directly compare to the reference aswell as for aesthetic reasons.
